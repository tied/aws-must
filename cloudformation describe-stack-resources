       AWS  CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
       deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS  CloudFormation  helps  you
       leverage  AWS  products  such  as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and
       Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost  effective
       applications without worrying about creating and configuring the under-
       lying AWS infrastructure.

       With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources  and  depen-
       dencies  in  a  template  file.  The  template  defines a collection of
       resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS  CloudFormation  creates
       and  deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all
       dependencies between the resources for you.
