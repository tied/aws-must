# aws-must - Minimum Viable Solution to Manage CloudFormation Templates

## The problem


Amazon CloudFormation]] gives developers and systems administrators an
easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources.
It uses JSON -formatted
[templates](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates)
for defining services to be managed together as a "stack".

However, the CF -templates soon become quite convoluted as the
complexity of the infrastructure stack increases. In addition, the
JSON format adds more to the management difficulties.


`aws-must` is
[Minimum Viable Solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
to manage CloudFormation templates.
