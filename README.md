# aws-must - Minimum Viable Solution to Manage CloudFormation Templates - $Release:0.0.10$

`aws-must` is a tool, which allows separating infrastructure
configuration and Amazon related syntax in CloudFormation JSON
templates using [YAML](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml) and
[Mustache templates](https://mustache.github.io/).

[3](https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/love-aws-part3-2/) for
background information on this tool.


## The Problem

[Amazon CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) gives
developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage
a collection of related AWS resources.  It uses JSON -formatted
[templates](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates)
for defining services to be managed together as a "stack".

However, the CF -templates soon become quite convoluted as the
complexity of the infrastructure stack increases. In addition, the
JSON format adds more to the management difficulties:

1. each stack is represented as a monolithic JSON document.

2. templates mix infrastructure specific configuration with the syntax
   stipulated by
   [Amazon CloudFormation Template Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html)

3. the JSON format doesn't support expressing references, and
   CloudFormation needs to use a
   [special syntax](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html)
   to define relations across template elements.

4. the JSON format doesn't support comments, which could be used to
   add documentation into the templates.

5. JSON documents repeat similar sections as resource instances are
   defined individually as sub-documents.

6.  JSON adds it own markup overhead to the configuration.

## The solution

`aws-tool` helps mitigating the problems presented in the chapter
above.  With the tool users may

1.  split stack configuration first in half, using YAML/mustache
    templates, and then further down using Mustache partials

2. separate infrastructure specific configuration from syntax
   stipulated by
   [Amazon CloudFormation Template Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html)
   using YAML and Mustache templates.

3. use YAML anchors to express dependencies between infrastructure
   elements.

4. add comments in YAML and Mustache templates. The tool supports a
   simple tag syntax (**&plus;&plus;start&plus;&plus;**
   **&plus;&plus;close&plus;&plus;** -tags) allowing documentation to
   be extracted directly from template files.

5. use Mustache partials to get rid of repeating similar sections in
   JSON configuration.

6. concentrate on configurations expressed in YAML (with minimal markdown).


## Installation

Add following lines to `Gemfile`

    source 'https://rubygems.org'
	gem 'aws-must'

and run

	bundle install
	

**Notice**: requires Ruby version ~> 2.0.

## Usage

### CLI  Usage

To get help 	

	aws-must.rb help

To create CloudFormation JSON template for `yaml_file` using default
template `./mustache/root.mustache` issue the command

	aws-must.rb gen yaml_file

The path of Mustache templates can be changed using `-t` option, or by
giving the name of a gem with a `-g` option. For example, to use the
latest version of
[aws-must-templates](https://github.com/jarjuk/aws-must-templates),
use the command

	aws-must.rb gen yaml_file -g aws-must-templates

The version constraint for the gem can be specified followed by a
comma -character. For example, to use version specification `~>0.0.1`,
issue the command

	aws-must.rb gen yaml_file -g 'aws-must-templates,~>0.0.1'

To extract documentation for the templates

	aws-must.rb doc 

The documentation command supports the same `-t` and `-g` options, as
the `gen` -command.

Documentation is extracted from lines surrounded by **+++start+++**
and **+++close+++** tags, or by **+++fold-on+++** and
**+++fold-off+++** tags. Examples documents for
[demo:html-7](https://rawgit.com/jarjuk/aws-must/master/generated-docs/7.html),
[demo:html-6](https://rawgit.com/jarjuk/aws-must/master/generated-docs/6.html),
[demo:html-5](https://rawgit.com/jarjuk/aws-must/master/generated-docs/5.html),
[demo:html-4](https://rawgit.com/jarjuk/aws-must/master/generated-docs/4.html),
and
[demo:html-3](https://rawgit.com/jarjuk/aws-must/master/generated-docs/3.html).
To see more information on how documentation is generated, issue the
the command

	aws-must.rb help doc 

To dump YAML `yaml_file` in JSON format

	aws-must.rb json yaml_file


### Demo Usage

Add the following lines to `Rakefile`


	spec = Gem::Specification.find_by_name 'aws-must'
	load "#{spec.gem_dir}/lib/tasks/demo.rake"


and verify that `demo` namespace is added to rake tasks

	rake -T demo

#### Demo Usage Locally

A list of demo cases is shown with the command

	rake -T demo:template
	
To show the CloudFormation JSON rendered for a demo case `i`, where
`i` ranges from `1,2,3, ...`, run rake task `dev:template-i`. For
example, for demo case `1` run

	rake demo:template-1

To show the difference of running case `i` vs. running the previous
demo case, run rake task `demo:diff-i`. For example, for demo case `2`
run

	rake demo:diff-2
	
**NOTICE:**: The [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) must be installed
for diff target to work.

To show html documentation extracted from demo case `i`, run rake task
`demo:html-i`. For example, for demo case `3` run

	rake demo:html-3

**NOTICE:**: Uses `markdown` command to convert
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) documentation
into html.

**NOTICE:**: Default browser `firefox` can be changed using command
line argument `browser`, e.g. `rake demo:html-3[chromium-browser]`.

#### Use Demo to Bootstrap Own Configuration

To create a copy of templates and YAML configuration for demo case `i`, 
run rake task `demo:bootstrap-i`, and pass template and
configuration directories as command line arguments. For example, to
copy demo case `4` templates to directory `tmp/tmpl`, and
configurations to directory `tmp/conf`, run

    rake demo:bootstrap-4[tmp/tmpl,tmp/conf]
	


#### Demo Usage on Amazon platform

Demo stacks can be provisioned on Amazon platform.

**WARNING** Provisioning CloudFormation templates on Amazon will be
**charged according to Amazon pricing policies**.

Prerequisites:

* [Install Amazon AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
* [Configure AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

To list demo targets provisioning Amazon run

	rake -T demo:stack-create

**NOTICE**: the region constraint in the output. Some of the templates
use fixed AMI configuration, which means that they work only if aws
-tool defines correct region (typically in set in `~/.aws/config`
file).


To create a `demo` stack for demo case `7` run

	rake  demo:stack-create-7
	
To show events generated when `demo` stack is created run

	rake  demo:stack-events
	
To show status of `demo` stack run

	rake  demo:stack-status

EC2 instances created in demo cases `7,8,...` accept ssh connections
via port 22.

Demo target `demo:stack-ssh` locates an ip address from a stack output
variable given as a parameter, and makes ssh connection to this ip
using the ssh identity given as a parameter.

For example, to use ip address in demo stack output variable `IP1`,
and the ssh private key in `~/.ssh/demo-key/demo-key`, run

    rake demo:stack-ssh[IP1,~/.ssh/demo-key/demo-key]

**NOTICE**: Use `rake  demo:stack-status` to show stack output variables.

**NOTICE**: The identity used must correspond to an existing
[Amazon EC2 Key Pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
with the name `demo-key`.


To delete `demo` stack

	rake  demo:stack-delete
